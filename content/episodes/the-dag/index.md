## Thinking Backwards

The most difficult paradigm shift when learning Snakemake is that you stop writing **imperative** instructions (Step A, then Step B) and start writing **declarative** goals.

In a Bash script, the logic is:
> "Run the skimmer. Then run the plotter."

In Snakemake, the logic is:
> "I want the plot. To get the plot, I need the skimmed file.
> To get the skimmed file, I need the raw data."

Snakemake determines the dependencies automatically by matching filenames.
If Rule A outputs `file.txt` and Rule B takes `file.txt` as input, Snakemake knows Rule A must run first.
This chain of dependencies is called a Directed Acyclic Graph (**DAG**).

## Activity: Extending the Analysis

We have a rule that skims data.
Now we want to count the events in that skimmed file.

Add this **second rule** to your `Snakefile` (below the first one):

```python
rule count_events:
    input:
        "skimmed_data.txt"
    output:
        "counts.txt"
    shell:
        "wc -l {input} > {output}"
```

**Crucial Link**: Notice that the `input` of `count_events` matches the `output` of `skim_data`.
This is how Snakemake builds the **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

## Running the Chain

Ask for the final result:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --cores 1 counts.txt
```

Snakemake realises:

1. You want to obtain `counts.txt`.
2. `count_events` can produce it, but it needs `skimmed_data.txt`.
3. `skim_data` can produce `skimmed_data.txt`.

Plan: Run `skim_data` -> Run `count_events`.

## The `rule all` Convention

By default, Snakemake runs the **first rule** from the top of the file
if you do not specify a target file.
To avoid typing `counts.txt` every time, we add a "dummy" rule at the very top.

Add this to the **top** of your Snakefile:

```python
rule all:
    input:
        "counts.txt"
```

Now you can run:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --cores 1
```

{{< challenge title="Lazy Execution (The \"Why\")" >}}

1. Run `pixi run snakemake --cores 1` again.

    What happens?

    ```output
    Assuming unrestricted shared filesystem usage.
    host: xxxx
    Building DAG of jobs...
    Nothing to be done (all requested files are present and up to date).
    ```

2. Modify the original raw data:

    ```bash
    touch raw_data.txt
    ```

    *For MacOS users*: some students have reported that touch does not remove the timestamp. In this case, you can remove the file and re-create it, or try to change the content.

3. Run Snakemake again.

    What happens?

{{< solution >}}

When you first run the command, Snakemake checks if `counts.txt` exists.
Since this is not the case,
it calculates the steps needed to create it.
The second time you run the command,
Snakemake sees that `counts.txt` exists and is newer than its inputs,
so it does nothing.

When you "touch" `raw_data.txt`, you update its modification time.
Snakemake notices that an input (`raw_data.txt`) is now strictly newer than the downstream files (`skimmed_data.txt` and `counts.txt`).
It marks them as "stale" and re-runs the chain.

**This is the crucial benefit for large analyses.**
If you had a workflow with 500 rules and you only modified the input for rule 499,
Snakemake would **not** re-run rules 1 through 498.
It selectively re-executes only the parts of the DAG that are affected by your change.
In CMS terms: if you change a plotting style,
you do not have to re-run the N-tupliser.
