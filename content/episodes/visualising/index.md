## Getting the Big Picture

As your analysis grows from 2 rules to 20, and from 3 samples to 300,
it becomes impossible to keep the entire workflow in your head.
Snakemake provides built-in tools to "draw" your analysis for you.

## The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Snakemake represents your workflow as a **DAG**:

- **Directed**: There is a clear flow from raw data to final plots.
- **Acyclic**: There are no loops (you can't have a file that depends on its own output).
- **Graph**: A mathematical structure of nodes (rules/files) and edges (dependencies).

### Generating the DAG

To create a visualisation,
we tell Snakemake to generate the DAG in a format called `dot`,
and then we use the `graphviz` tool to turn it into an image.

First, we need to install it:

```bash
pixi add graphviz
```

Run the tool:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag.png
# pixi run snakemake --dag | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf   ### For PDF format
```

How to read the DAG:

- **Nodes (Boxes)**: Represent the jobs that need to be run.
- **Arrows**: Represent the flow of data.
- **Solid vs. Dashed lines**: In many viewers, a dashed border indicates that the file already exists and the job doesn't need to run.

1. Ensure you have the Snakefile from the previous episode with `DYJets`,
   `TTbar`, and `Data`. If you also completed the optional `WJets` challenge,
   your DAG will contain one additional branch.

2. Run the DAG command:

  ```bash
  pixi run snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > dag.png
  ```

{{< callout type="note" title="For MacOS users" >}}

It has been reported that the command above may not work due to differences in how `dot` is handled.
If you encounter issues, try the following command instead:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --dag | pixi run dot -Tpng > dag.png
```

or you can run:

```bash
pixi run dot -C
pixi run snakemake --dag | pixi run dot -Tpng > dag.png
```

3. Open `dag.png`, it should look like the following image.
Notice how the branches for each dataset are parallel.

Look at your DAG.
If you were to run this on a machine with only **1 core**, how many steps would it take?
If you had **4 cores**, how would the timing change?

{{< solution >}}

With 1 core, Snakemake runs every job sequentially.
With 4 cores, Snakemake can run up to four independent `select_events` jobs at
the same time, which reduces the total wall-clock time before the final gather
step runs.
This is the power of a DAG-based system!

If you have 1,000 samples, the `--dag` command will produce a giant PDF with 1,000 boxes,
which is unreadable.
To see a simplified version that only shows how the rules connect (ignoring the individual samples), use:

```bash
pixi run snakemake --rulegraph | dot -Tpng > rulegraph.png
```

This is often much more useful for complex CMS analyses to ensure the logic is correct.

## The Dry-Run: "Look Before You Leap"

Before you submit 1,000 jobs to a cluster, you should always perform a **Dry-Run**.
This tells Snakemake to calculate the DAG and print the execution plan without actually running any commands.

```bash
pixi run snakemake -n
```

If you want more detail (like seeing the actual shell commands that will be executed), use:

```bash
pixi run snakemake -n -p
```

{{< details title="Did the previous command work?" >}}

If you run this commands on top of finished workflow, you should see something like:

```output
Building DAG of jobs...
Nothing to be done (all requested files are present and up to date).
```

This is expected, because all the output files already exist. If you change something in your Snakefile (like adding a new rule or changing an existing one), the dry-run will show you which jobs need to be re-run.

Alternatively, if you want to see the dry-run or the commands to execute, use:

```bash
pixi run snakemake -n -p --forceall
```
