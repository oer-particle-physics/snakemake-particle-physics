## Scaling Up: From One File to Many

In CMS, we never have just one "raw_data.txt". We have `DYJets`, `TTbar`, `WJets`, and various `Data` eras. Writing a rule for each one would be a nightmare.

Snakemake handles this using **Wildcards**.

---

## The Wildcard Syntax

A wildcard is a placeholder in curly braces `{}`. For example, instead of writing a rule that only processes `TTbar.txt`, we can write a generic rule that works for any sample:

```python
rule skim_data:
    input:
        "raw/{sample}.txt"
    output:
        "skimmed/{sample}.txt"
    shell:
        "grep 'Signal' {input} > {output}"
```

### How does it work?

When you ask for `skimmed/TTbar.txt`, Snakemake looks at the rule and sees it can create `skimmed/{sample}.txt`. It "pattern matches" and determines that `{sample}` must be `TTbar`. It then looks for the input `TTbar.txt`.

**Crucial Rule**: Snakemake works **backwards**. It looks at the output you requested, matches it to the output pattern of a rule, determines the wildcard value, and then fills in that value for the input.

---

## The `expand()` function

If you have 100 samples, you don't want to type them all in your `rule all`. Snakemake provides a helper function called `expand()` to generate lists of files.

```python
SAMPLES = ["DYJets", "TTbar", "WJets"]

rule all:
    input:
        expand("skimmed/{s}.txt", s=SAMPLES)
```

The `expand()` function takes a pattern and replaces the placeholders with the values in your list. The code above produces: `["skimmed/DYJets.txt", "skimmed/TTbar.txt", "skimmed/WJets.txt"]`

{{< callout type="note" title="Wildcards vs. Expand Variables" >}}

Notice a subtle difference:

1. In `rule skim_data`, we used `{sample}`.
This is a **Wildcard** (Snakemake figures it out based on the filename).
2. In `rule all`, we used `{s}` inside `expand()`.
This is a Python string formatting variable.

They do not need to match! `expand()` happens before the rules run to generate the list of target files. The rules run after to figure out how to create those files.

## Activity: Processing Multiple Datasets

{{< instructor >}}

* **Parallelism:** This is the best moment to explain why the `--cores` flag matters. In HEP, we are used to sending 100 jobs to Condor. Here, we show they can run 4 (or 8, or 16) jobs in parallel locally on their laptop with zero extra effort.
* **The "Pattern Matching" Warning:** Students often try to put wildcards in the `input` that aren't in the `output`. I would emphasize that Snakemake works **backwards**: it sees a file it wants (the output) and then tries to figure out what the input should be.

{{</ instructor >}}

Let's modify our `Snakefile` to handle three different simulated datasets.

1. Open your `Snakefile` and modify it as follows:

  ```python
  # 1. Define our datasets
  DATASETS = ["DYJets", "TTbar", "Data"]

  rule all:
      input:
          expand("results/{d}_counts.txt", d=DATASETS)

  # 2. Updated Skim rule with wildcards
  rule skim_data:
      input:
          "raw/{dataset}.txt"
      output:
          "skimmed/{dataset}.txt"
      shell:
          "grep 'Signal' {input} > {output} || true"

  # 3. Updated Count rule with wildcards
  rule count_events:
      input:
          "skimmed/{dataset}.txt"
      output:
          "results/{dataset}_counts.txt"
      shell:
          "wc -l {input} > {output}"
  ```

2. Prepare the "raw" directory and files:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p raw
  echo -e "Signal\nBackground" > raw/DYJets.txt
  echo -e "Signal\nSignal\nBackground" > raw/TTbar.txt
  echo -e "Background\nBackground" > raw/Data.txt
  ```

3. Run the workflow. Note that we use --cores 4 to allow Snakemake to run independent jobs in parallel:

  ```bash
  pixi run snakemake --cores 4
  ```

{{< challenge title="Adding a new sample" >}}

Add a new dataset called `WJets` to your `DATASETS` list.

1. Create the dummy file `raw/WJets.txt` with some "Signal" lines.
2. Run Snakemake again.

{{< solution >}}

Observe how Snakemake only runs the rules for the new `WJets` sample and skips the ones that were already finished (`DYJets`, `TTbar`, `Data`).
